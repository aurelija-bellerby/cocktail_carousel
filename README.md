## Brief
Create an application using the Flutter framework and Cocktail API.
* It must dynamically pull data from the Cocktail API.
* It should be interactive. It should allow the user to click a button to generate a random cocktail and then, once generated, click another button to view more information about that cocktail on another screen (e.g. recipe and/or ingredients list).
